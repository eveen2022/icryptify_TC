    <h1>Non-Refundable Policy</h1>
    <p>Thank you for choosing iCryptify for your trading needs. We are committed to providing you with a powerful and feature-rich platform to enhance your trading experience. Please take a moment to read and understand our non-refundable policy. </p>

    <p class="text-white">
        <strong>1. Payment</strong><br>
        By subscribing to iCryptify's services, you acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for the payment of the chosen subscription plan. Payments are processed through secure payment gateways, and the subscription fee is non-refundable once payment is successfully processed. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-white">
        <strong>2. Non-Refundable Services</strong><br>
        All iCryptify subscription plans are non-refundable. This means that once you have made the payment and your subscription is activated, we do not provide refunds or credits for any unused subscription period, regardless of the reason for cancellation.
    </p>

    <p class="text-white">
        <strong>3. Cancellation and Termination </strong><br>
        You can cancel your subscription at any time, and the cancellation will be effective at the end of your current billing cycle. Upon cancellation, you will not be billed for subsequent billing cycles, and your access to iCryptify's services will continue until the end of the current billing cycle. However, no refunds will be provided for the remaining portion of the current billing cycle. 
    </p>

    <p class="text-white">
        <strong>4. Subscription Changes</strong><br>
        If you decide to upgrade or downgrade your subscription plan, the change will take effect at the beginning of the next billing cycle. Any change in subscription plan will not result in a refund for the remaining portion of the current billing cycle. 
    </p>

    <p class="text-white">
        <strong>5. Technical Issues </strong><br>
        We strive to provide a seamless and reliable platform, but technical issues may occasionally arise. If you encounter any technical problems while using iCryptify, please contact our support team for assistance. While we will do our best to resolve any technical issues promptly, these issues do not qualify for refunds. 
    </p>

    <p class="text-white">
        <strong>6. Changes to the Non-Refundable Policy</strong><br>
        Cryptify reserves the right to modify, amend, or change this non-refundable policy at any time without prior notice. Changes to the policy will be effective upon posting on our website. It is your responsibility to review this policy periodically.<br><br>

        By subscribing to iCryptify's services, you agree to the terms and conditions outlined in this non-refundable policy.
